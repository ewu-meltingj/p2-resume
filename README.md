* Not sure if I was supposed to use nav, aside, article..... if so then my bad.
* https://css-tricks.com/examples/ShapesOfCSS/ was the code that I used for the hex. I then combined that with floats and math to create my hex grid.
* the animation for everything works on my ipad, android phone, and the maccccccs. MINUS!!!! the hover for the image. I was able to use :focus when changing my div to an anchor tag but then it had this weird flicker that I found annoying. I will look into other solutions for this problem later.
* In the future I will make my own custom icons with svg. This is due to the page loading and then the icons loading lattttter. So annoying.
* I think that is all of the comments needed for this.
* Oh yeah, I was not sure if the content needed to be real or not. sooooooooooooo some may or may not be real.
*I HOPE YOU LIKE ALL OF THAT CORN FLOWER BLUE! IT'S ALL THAT I USED :)*
